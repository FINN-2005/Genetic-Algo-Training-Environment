# Genetic-Algo-Training-Environment
The plan is to make a module for my [pygame_template](https://github.com/FINN-2005/pygame_template.git) to:
- Create a physics based training environment for the AI
- Have pre-built option to create, train and test AI
- potentially integrate support to implement this with all my other future modules in my pygame wrapper

## Current Progress
For now, this is just a way to build shapes out of lines

## next additions
Collisions, Physics and simulation controll(pause, speedup, etc).

## Requirements
Install my [pygame_template](https://github.com/FINN-2005/pygame_template.git)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/FINN-2005/pygame_tempale.git
```

## Run
```bash
python sim.py
```
